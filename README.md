# Guessing-Game
This is a simple number guessing game in C.


In the process of learning C and decided this to be my first small project. This is 
based on a lab assignment that was done in Python with the exact same concept.


**Planning:**

  Add a new file that I can import where it checks for valid user input. 
  Only allow for interger input and within the range of 1 - 100.
